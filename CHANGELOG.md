# Change Log

See the [Gatsby CHANGELOG.md](./packages/gatsby/CHANGELOG.md)

---

Gatsby is distributed as a [monorepo][monorepo] using [lerna][lerna]. Several other large open-source projects are distributed this way, including [babel][babel], [react][react], etc.

This means that our CHANGELOG.md files are distributed alongside the package itself in the `packages` directory.

For example, the package `gatsby` has a CHANGELOG.md in [`packages/gatsby/CHANGELOG.md`](./packages/gatsby/CHANGELOG.md). If you'd like to check out others, check out the [`packages`](./packages) directory in the root of the repo.

[babel]: https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages
[react]: https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages
